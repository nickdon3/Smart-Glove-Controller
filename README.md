# Smart-Glove-Controller
Using an accelerometer, 2 optical sensors, and a Feather M4 microcontroller, I hacked the carâ€™s original controller. By stripping the wiring and soldering on my own system, I built a glove-based control interface. Hand movements and gestures, like making a fist, drove the car, while twisting your wrists steered. Optical sensors adjusted speed based on light while the accelerometer detected motion in the x/y directions to guide the car. I also coded voltage control: 3.3V to drive forward, 0V to reverse, and similar voltage intakes for steering right vs left. Finally, I wired built-in headlights with an additional optical sensor, activated by low-light conditions, adding another layer of fun to the custom car. In order to control the car I developed python code based off of example code provided by the Adafruit website where I also acquired my sensors and Feather M4. Aftering modifying the various pieces of code to suit my needs, I fused them together to deliver the final Smart-Glove controlled vehicle. The specific sensors used were the LSM6DSOX accelerometer and APDS 9960 proximity/gesture sensors. Prototyping and testing were conducted on a breadboard before building the glove itself and fixing new wiring.
