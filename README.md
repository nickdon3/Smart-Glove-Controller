# Smart-Glove-Controller
My partner and I created a smart-glove-controlled RC car, inspired by Batman/Iron Man. We hacked the carâ€™s controller using an accelerometer, optical sensors, and a Feather M4 microcontroller. Hand gestures drove the car, wrist twists steered, and sensors adjusted speed. Headlights activated in low light. We developed python code to run the system.
