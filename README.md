# Smart-Glove-Controller
Using an accelerometer, 2 optical sensors, and a Feather M4 microcontroller, we hacked the carâ€™s original controller. By stripping the wiring and soldering on our own system, we built a glove-based control interface. Hand movements and gestures, like making a fist, drove the car, while twisting your wrists steered. Optical sensors adjusted speed based on light while the accelerometer detected motion in the x/y directions to guide the car. We also coded voltage control: 3.3V to drive forward, 0V to reverse, and similar voltage intakes for steering right vs left. Finally, we wired built-in headlights with an additional optical sensor, activated by low-light conditions, adding another layer of fun to our custom car. In order to control the car we developed our python code based off of example code provided by the Adafruit website where we acquired our sensors and Feather M4. Aftering modifying the various pieces of code to suit our needs, we fused them together to deliver the final Smart-Glove controlled vehicle.The specific sensors used were the LSM6DSOX accelerometer and APDS 9960 proximity/gesture sensors. Prototyping and testing were conducted on a breadboard before building the glove itself and fixing new wiring.
